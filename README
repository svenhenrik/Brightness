Brightness Android app widget

A very simple app widget for the Android home screen. Clicking 
the widget toggles between automatic and miminum brightness settings.

Known issues:
 #1 : Sometimes, when unlocking the screen, the widget shows "Auto" 
      but clicking the widget will switch to "Auto" as if it was 
      off.
